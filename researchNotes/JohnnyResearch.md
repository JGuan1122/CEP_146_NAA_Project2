The massive inflation of AI related economies have caused an AI Bubble, this results in layoffs in recent times.



\## The AI bubble:

-Sudden massive investment in AI, whether generative or agentic

-These massive investments cause the AI sector to be fueled by debt, and due to circular financing, this results in an unsteady investment that could collapse anytime.

&nbsp;	-Furthermore, these types of investments are only inflating the bubble even bigger.

&nbsp;	-Promises of AIs fully replacing jobs (due to more and more demands of AI progress) causes layoffs, and AI first companies.  

&nbsp;	-A worry is that as more AI replaces, there would be more saturation in the market (both due to less job openings, and AI replacing jobs) due to less demand for the job, this threatens the future generation.
